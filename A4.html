        <p class="content">The first step in understanding how to position 
            elements is to understand the fundamental model of CSS -the box model. </p> 
        <h1 class="heading">The Box Model </h1>
        <p class="content" style="margin-top: 0px;">Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the 
            boundaries and the borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there.
             A <i>div</i> element creates a box, as do <i>h1,img,span, </i>and <i>td</i> elements. Each box has properties 
             you can set with CSS. I'vellustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.</p><br>
             <h3 class="heading">Figure 1 Border, padding, and margin </h3>
             <p class="content" style="margin-top: 0px;">The <i>padding</i> of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box's border, and the <i> margin</i> is 
                the distance between a box and any adjacent element. In other words, padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside the border in the following css, 
                I set both the padding and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white space in Figure 1. </p>
               <p class="content" style="margin-top: 0px;">The border surrounding overy element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can change the color of an element's 
                border, as well as the thickness and line style the browser uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 
                is the result of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line around the box that each div 
                element creates</p>
